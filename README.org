#+title: A simple working example for custom-nixpkgs
The goal of this repository is to provide a bare bones example for working with the [[https://github.com/Open-Systems-Innovation/custom-nixpkgs][custom-nixpkgs]] repo

* How it works
The current repository contains the source code for the project ~hello-nix~. The ~custom-nixpkgs~ repo contains a nix package at ~/custom-nixpkgs/pkgs/by-name/hello-nix/package.nix~ that uses ~stdenv.mkDerivation~ to build a derivation of ~hello-nix~ in the users ~nix/store~.

If the user is using NixOS, they can overlay their packages with the ~custom-nixpkgs~ overlay and have access to ~hello-nix~ in their system.
